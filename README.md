## Reflection
Completing Assignment H.0.1 helped me understand the importance of GitHub as more than just a place to store files. GitHub allows developers to track changes, document their work, and collaborate efficiently with others. Learning how to properly commit changes emphasized accountability and organization, which are critical in software development.

Writing this README required me to think critically about how to clearly explain the purpose of a project to others. Documentation plays an important role in making projects understandable and usable, especially in collaborative environments. Overall, this assignment provided a strong foundation in GitHub fundamentals that will be valuable throughout this course and in future academic and professional projects.
